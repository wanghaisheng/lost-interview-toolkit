[Music] yeah I'm I'm ready you guys ready okay it's April 20th 1995 this is the uh Smithsonian interview for Steve Jobs okay I'd like to begin Steve with some background biographical information tell us about uh when you were born where your parents your family childhood memories uh I was born in San Francisco California USA um planet Earth on February 24th 1955 um I could go into a lot of details of my youth but I don't know that anybody really care about that too much well might in 300 years cuz all this print's going to disintegrate tell tell me a little bit about your parents your family what what are the earliest things you remember um 55 eow was still president yeah I don't remember him but uh I do remember growing up in the you know sort of the very late 50s early 60s a very interesting time in the United States of America America was sort of at its Pentacle of post World War II Prosperity I think and everything had been fairly straight and narrow um from haircuts to to to culture in every way and it was just starting to kind of broaden into the 60s where things were going to start expanding out in new directions but it hadn't quite gone that way and everything was still very successful um very young America seemed very very young and naive in many ways to me um from my memories of that time oh yeah so you would have been a about five or six years old when John Kennedy was right I remember John Kennedy being assassinated I remember the the the the exact moment I heard that he had been shot where were you when I was walking across the grass of my schoolyard going home at about 3 in the afternoon and uh somebody yelled out that the president had been shot and killed um and I I that was I must have been about seven or eight years old then I guess and uh I knew exactly what it meant I also remember very much the um the Cuban Missile Crisis um I probably didn't sleep for three or four nights because I was afraid if I went to sleep I wouldn't wake up and I I absolutely you know even at I guess it I was about six seven years old years old yeah again I understood exactly what was going on I think everybody did and and it was a really a terror that that I will never forget in my life and probably has never really left um and I think that everyone felt it at that time oh yeah um those of us who are older I remember in being in high school and making plans of where we'd meet if the country was devastated it was a strange strange time one of the things we're trying to get a handle on is um uh sort of passion and power and um early things that you were passionate about uh that you were really interested in uh that I was very lucky I had a father named Paul who was uh a pretty remarkable man he was he never graduated from high school um he joined the Coast Guard in World War II and fed troops around the world for General patent I guess and he I think he was always getting into trouble and getting busted down to what's private I think is the lowest right yeah but uh he was a machinist by trade and um worked very hard and was kind of a genius with his hands and he had a workbench out in the garage where when I was about five or six he sectioned off a little piece of it and said Steve this is your workbench now and he gave me some of his smaller tools you know showed me how to use a hammer and a saw and how to build things and um it it really was very good for me you know he spent a lot of time with me teaching me how to build things take things apart put things back together and one of the things that he touched upon was Electronics um he did not have a a deep understanding of electronics himself but he he um he' encountered Electronics a lot in automobiles and other things that he would fix so he showed me the rudiments of electronics and I got very interested in that and um then a a I grew up in Silicon Valley my parents moved from San Francisco to Mountain View when I was five my dad got in transfer and um that was right in the heart of Silicon Valley um so there were engineers kind of all around and Silicon Valley at that time was still Orchards for the most part I mean it was apricot Orchards and prune Orchards and it was really Paradise uh I remember there not being I remember almost every day the air being Crystal Clear where you could see from one end of the valley to the other this was when you were six seven eight years old time exactly and it was it was really the most wonderful place in the world to grow up and there was a man that moved in down the street maybe about six or seven houses down the block who was new in the neighborhood with his wife and uh it turned out he was an engineer at huet Packard and he was a ham radio operator and really into electronics and what he did to get to know the Kids on the Block was a rather strange thing he put out a a carbon microphone and a battery and a speaker on his driveway where you could talk into the microphone and your voice would get Amplified on the speaker it's kind of a strange thing to do when you move into a neighborhood but that's what he did this is great and uh I of course started messing around with this and I'd always been taught that you needed an amplifier to amplify the voice of a microphone for it to come out of a speaker yeah my father had taught me that so I went home and proudly announced to my father that he was all wrong and that this man up the block was amplifying voice with just a battery my father told me I didn't know what I was talking about we got into very large argument about this so I dragged him down and showed him this and he himself was a little befuddled um and I I got to know this man whose name was Larry Lang and uh he taught me a lot of electronics too he was great and he used to build you know Heath kits which they don't really have anymore but Heath kits were really great um they these uh Heath kits were these these products that you would buy in kit form you'd actually pay more money for them than you would if you just went and bought the finished product if it was available uh but these Heath kits would come with detailed manuals and on how to put this thing together and all the parts would be laid out in a certain way and colorcoded and you'd actually build this thing yourself and I would say that g that gave one several things it gave one an understanding of what was inside a finished product and how it worked because it would all include a theory of operation but maybe even more importantly it gave one the sense that one could build the things that one saw around on self in the universe I mean you see these things were not Mysteries anymore when you looked at a television set you would think well I I haven't built one of those but I could there's one of those in the heath kit catalog and I built two other Heath kits so I could build a television set I could build you nothing things became much more clear that they were the results of human creation not these magical things that just appeared in one's environment and one had no knowledge of their Interiors so it gave one a tremendous degree of self-confidence that that through exploration and learning one could understand seemingly very complex things in one's environment and um so you know that was my childhood was very fortunate in that way I I had a rough time in school it sounds like you were really lucky to have your dad as both a sort of a mentor and a and a hero and I was going to ask you about school uh what was uh what what was the formal side of your education like good school was pretty hard for me at the beginning my my mother had taught me how to read before I got to school and so when I got there I really just wanted to do two things I wanted to read books because I love reading books and I wanted to go outside and Chase butterflies and do all the things that you know 5-year-olds like to do and I encountered uh authority of a different kind than I'd ever encountered before and I did not like it and they they really they almost got me they really almost they came this close to really beating any curiosity out of me by the time I was in third grade I'd had a a good buddy of mine Rick fantino and the only way we had fun was to create Mischief we used to do things like um I remember one time we traded everybody that there was a big bike rack where everybody put their bikes maybe a hundred bikes in this bike rack and we traded everybody our lock combinations for theirs on an individual basis and then went out one day and put everybody's lock and everybody else's bike and it took him till about 10 o'clock that night to get all the bikes unsorted and stuff like that we'd set off explosives and teachers desks and stuff and it was it was pretty serious we got kicked out of school a lot and in fourth grade I encountered one of the other Saints in my life which was u i they discovered they were going to put me and this guy Rick fantino into the same fourth grade class and the principal said at the last minute no no bad idea separate them so this teacher Mrs Hill said I'll take one of them and she taught the advanced fourth grade class and thank God I was the the random one that got got put in her class and um she watched me for about two weeks and she then approached me she said Stephen I'll tell you what I um I'll make you a deal I have this math workbook and if you take it home and finish it on your own without any help and you bring it back to me if you get it 80% right I will give you $5 in one of these really big suckers she bought it she held it out in front of me one of these giant things and I looked at her like are you crazy lady you know nobody's ever done this before and of course I did it and she basic basically bribed me back into learning uh with with with uh candy and money and and what was really remarkable was that you know before very long I had such a respect for her that I I sort of reignited my desire to learn and she was remarkable she um she got me kits for making cameras you know I ground my own lens and made a camera and it was it was really quite wonderful uh and I think I probably learned more academically that one year than I've ever learned in my life um and it was it was it created problems though because when I got out of fourth grade um they wanted they tested me and they decided to put me in high school and my parents said no thank god oh they said he can Skip One grade but that's all but not to high school not to high school no way no how that's and I found skipping one grade you know to be very Troublesome in anyways uh so that was plenty enough and um but it it did create some problems is um I'm going to get myself a little out of order here but this seems like such a good place to talk about it is your experience in that fourth grade class and do you think that had a major in impact on on your own interest in education I mean if there's anyone in the computer industry that that's associated with computers and education it's got to be you and and yeah and apple I'm sure it did but it you know I'm a very I'm a very big believer in equal opportunity as opposed to equal outcome I don't believe in equal outcome because unfortunately life's not like that and it'd be a pretty boring place if it was but I really believe in equal opportunity and equal opportunity to me more than anything means a great education probably you know the second maybe even more important is a great family life but I don't know how to do that I don't think anybody knows how to do that but it it pains me because we do know how to do provide a great education we really do if we got our act together we could make sure that every young child in this country got a great education and we fall far short of that and I know know from my own education that if I hadn't encountered two or three individuals that spent extra time with me I'm sure I would have been in jail I'm 100% sure if it hadn't been for Mrs Hill in fourth grade and a few others but maybe even especially her I absolutely would have ended up in jail and because I could you know I could see those tendencies in myself to sort of have a certain energy to do something and it could have been directed to doing something interesting that you know other people thought was a good idea or doing something interesting that other people maybe didn't like so much put you in jail right and and so you know I think when you're young a little bit of course correction goes a long way and and I think it takes pretty talented people to do that and and I don't know that enough of them get attracted to go into public education you can't even support a family on what you get paid uh on what you get paid and if you're smart I sort of feel if somebody's smart enough to that you want to turn your kids over to them for the majority of their their childhood I mean the majority of their waking hours in their childhood are spent not with your parents but with your teachers sure I like the people that are teaching my kids to be good enough that they could get a job at the company I work for making $100,000 a year well why should they work at a school for $35 $40,000 a year if they could get a job here $100,000 a year absolutely I mean that's not an is that an intelligence test I mean soly I think we should basically be hiring them and paying them $100,000 a year but the problem there of course is the unions the unions are the worst thing that ever happened to education um because it's not a meritocracy yeah exactly it turns into a bureaucracy which is exactly what's happened and teachers can't teach and administrators run the place and nobody can be fired it's terrible well some some people say that the that this new technology may be a um the network world if if you will may be a way to bypass that are you optimistic I absolutely don't believe that and as you pointed out I've probably helped put more computers and more schools than anybody else in the world and I'm up until this point in time and I'm absolutely convinced that that is by no means the most important thing now the most important thing is another person another person that incites your curiosity that guides your curiosity that feeds your curiosity and machines cannot do that in the same way people can um the the the elements of of Discovery are around you you don't need a computer to know I mean you know here why does that fall you know why nobody knows why nobody in the entire world knows why that falls we can describe it pretty accurately but no one knows why I don't need a computer to get a kid interested in that to spend a week playing with gravity and trying to understand it and come up with reasons why but you do need a person you do need a person and so especially with computers the way they are now the way they are now computers are very reactive but they're not they are not proactive they are not agents if you will they are very reactive so what what children need is something much more proactive and they need a guide they don't need uh an assistant and I think we have the material to solve this problem in the world it's just being deployed in other places and I I've been very strong believer that what we need to do in education is go to the full voucher system I know this isn't what you this is what I care about a great deal well this is exactly what we care about this was this was believe it or not this is at the this was at the end and we one of the things that I I feel um is that right now um you know if you ask who are the customers of Education the customers of Education are the society at large employers that hire people right things like that But ultimately I think the customers are the parents not even the students but the parents the problem that we have in this country is that the customers went away the customers stopped paying attention to their schools for the most part and gave their kids to the well what happened was was that mothers started working and they didn't have time to spend at PTA meetings and watching their kids school um schools became much more institutionalized and parents spent less and less and less time involved in their kids education and what happens when a customer goes away and a monopoly gets control which is what's happened in our country is that the service level almost always goes down I remember seeing a bumper sticker when the telephone company was all one AT&T the Bell System I remember seeing a a bumper sticker with the Bell logo on it and it said we don't care we don't have to you know and that's what a monopoly is sure that's what IBM was in their day and that's certainly what this the public school system is they don't have to care now it turns out let's um go through some economics the most expensive thing most people buy in their lives is a house second most expensive thing is a car usually and a car cost average cars approximately about $20,000 now6 $220,000 and an average car lasts about what 8 years why you buy another one so approximately um you know $2,000 a year right for eight-year commitment well your child goes to school right uh approximately eight years in k through eight right right you don't like to switch schools it's about an eight-year commitment what does the State of California spend per pupil per year I have no idea and a public school I have no idea what they spend per year per pupil is about $4,400 wow okay about twice as over twice as much as a car now it turns out that when you go to buy a car you have a lot of information available to you to make a choice and you have a lot of choices oh yeah I mean General Motors and Ford and Toyota and Chrysler and Nissan they are advertising at me like crazy I can't get through a day without seeing car ads and they seem to be able to make these cars efficiently enough that they can afford to take some of my money and advertise other people with it so that everybody knows all about these cars and they keep getting better and better and better each because a lot of competition and there's a warranty and there's a warranty that's right but in schools since people don't feel like they're spending their own money they feel like it's free oh yeah right no one does any comparison shopping matter of fact if you want want to put your kid in a private school you can't take the $4,400 a year out of the public school and use it you have to come up with you know5 or $6,000 of your own or even $4,400 of your own money sure are more I believe very strongly that if the the country gave each parent a voucher a check for $4,400 that they could only spend at any accredited school that several things would happen number one schools would start marketing themselves like crazy to parents to get students secondly I think you see a lot of new Schools starting I've suggested as an example if you go to Stanford Business School they have a public policy track they could start a school administrator track so you could get a bunch of people coming out of college tying up with somebody just got out of business school they could be starting their own schools sure you could have 25y old kids out of college very idealistic full of energy instead of starting a Silicon Valley company they'd start a school and I believe they would do far better than many our Public School teachers do the third thing you'd see is I believe that you would see the quality of schools again just like in a competitive market start to rise some schools go broke a lot of the public schools would go broke there's no question about it it would be rather painful for the first several years and deservedly so and but I think far less painful than the kids going through the system as it is right now and some people the biggest complaint is of course that schools would pick off all the good kids and all the bad kids would be left to wall together in either a you know a a private school or the REM remnants of the public school to me that's like saying well all the car manufacturers are going to make BMWs and Mercedes and nobody's going to make a $10,000 car well I think the most hotly competitive market right now is the $10,000 car area you've got you know all the Japanese playing in it you've got General Motors that spent $5 billion subsidizing Saturn so far so that they can compete in that market you've got four which has just introduced two new cars in that market you've got Chrysler with the neon so so you're spending 32,000 and you're getting a $500 used car in some cases the the market competition model seems to indicate that where there is a need there is a lot of providers willing to tailor their products to fit that need and a lot of competition which keeps forcing them to get better and better so I think the problems we've got I used to think when I I was in my 20s that technology was the solution to most of the world's problems and unfortunately it ain't so um it's it's sort of I give you an analogy a lot of times we think why is television programming so bad why are television shows so so demeaning so uh so poor and the first thought that occurs to you is well there's a conspiracy the this is the networks are feeding us this slop uh because it's cheap to produce because of this because of that it's the networks that are controlling this and they are feeding us this stuff to try to dumb down the American public but the truth of the matter of course if you if you studied in any depth is the networks absolutely want to give people what they want so that they watch the shows if people wanted something different they would get it and the truth of the matter is the shows that are on television are on television because that's what people want the majority of the people in this country want to turn on the television and turn off their brain and that's what they get and that's far more depressing than a conspiracy it's conspiracies are much more fun than the truth of the matter which is that a vast majority of the American public are pretty mindless most of the time be um I think the school situation is equally there's a parallel here when it comes to technology it is so much more hopeful to think that technology can solve the problems that are really more human and more organizational and more political in nature and and it ain't so we need to attack these things at the root which is people and how we how much Freedom we give people the people the competition that will attract the best people unfortunately the side effect of pushing out a lot of 46 year old teachers that lost their Spirit you know 15 years ago and shouldn't be teaching right now now so I think uh I feel very strongly about this and I wish it was as simple as giving every kid a computer but it won't work yeah and I'm really glad we had a chance to to talk about it uh uh up front sure I'm going to take change the tape and go back go back I'm sorry I'm sure the Nea will like grab then wanted to make sure that we we got covered and one of the things was about um the books about uh your life and career uh so much has been written about you rather than than go over a lot of uh those stories I'm was going to ask if there are any of those books or which one do you think is the best and and the fairest and if there there are aspects that that of your career that you think have been left out that you'd like to have addressed I I have to tell you truly I I'm pretty ignorant about that because I haven't read of them um I read I I skimmed one one time and and the first page I skimmed one maybe read about 10% of it and I I read the first page of another and it it got my birthday Wrong by a year and I thought well if they can't even get this right then I this is probably not worth reading the one that I skimmed I don't remember which one it was but you know I I've always considered part of my job was to keep the quality level of people in the organizations I work with very high I mean that's what I consider one of the few things I actually you know can contribute individually myself uh versus the team that I work with is is is to really try to instill in the organization the goal of having only a players because in the field that I'm in like in a lot of fields the difference between um maybe a uh a good the worst taxi cab driver and the best taxi cab driver to get you cross Town Manhattan might be two to one best one will get you there in 15 minutes the worst one will get you there in half an hour or um you know the best uh the best cook and the worst cook maybe it's three to one you know pick something like that most things in life the best you know post person the worst postp person in in the field that I'm in the diff in software in particular the difference between and the best person and the worst person is about a 100 to one or more the difference between a good software person and a great software person is probably 50 to1 25 to 50 to1 huge dynamic range and therefore I have found and not just in software but almost everything I've done it really pays to go after the the best people in the world it's painful it's very painful when you have some people that are not the best people in the world and you have to get rid of them to tell them but I found that my job has sometimes been exactly that to get rid of some of the people that didn't measure up and I've always tried to do it in a humane way but nonetheless it has to be done and it's not ever fun is that the hardest and most painful part of managing a company from your point of view oh sure of course and so but I I've been you know at times I've been pretty hard about it and a lot of times people haven't wanted to leave and I haven't given them any choices so if somebody wanted to write a book about me um most of my friends would never talk to them but they could go find you know the handful of a few dozen people that I'd fired in my life that hated my guts and that was certainly the case in this one book I skimmed I mean it was just let's let's throw the darts at Steve oh yeah and you know such as life I mean that's the the sort of the world I've chosen to live in um and if you know if I didn't like that part of it enough I'd escape and I haven't so I'm willing to put up with that but I certainly didn't find it very accurate okay then that this gives us a golden opportunity then to to let you tell your own own own story for for a while and I've got a couple of questions I wanted to ask you about uh specifically about your experience at Apple I mean looking back at the years you were there um um what in your own view were your your the accomplishments that you were most proud of uh are there a couple of Apple stories that you really like to tell oh Apple was this incredible journey I mean we we did some amazing things there um the thing that bound us together at Apple was not it was it was the ability to make things that were going to change the world that was very important to all of us and we were all pretty young the average age of the company was you know mid to late 20s and um we were you know hardly anybody had families certainly at the beginning and we all worked like maniacs and um the greatest joy was that we felt we were fashioning sort of collective works of art much like uh you know 20th century physics or anything that you know something important that would last that a lot of people contributed to and we could actually then after you know very few people could engineer these things but then they could give them to more people who could as an example build an automated Factory to build them and then they could give them to even more people who could use them and the amplification Factor was very large I mean in doing the Macintosh as an example there were a core group of less than a 100 people that did the mac and yet Apple ship well over 10 million of them so and and of course everybody's copied it so if you look at what's really happening it's in you know hundreds of millions at this point in time U that's pretty large amplification right you know million to one and it's not often in your life that you get that opportunity to amplify your values 100 to one a million to one and and that's really what we were doing I mean if you look at what we did what we tried to do was to say computation and how it relates to people is really it's infancy here and we are in the right place at the right time to change the course of that Vector a little bit and what's interesting is if you change the course of a vector near its origin you know by the time it gets a few miles out it's way different and we were very cognizant of this fact really from almost the beginning at Apple that we we were for some incredibly lucky reason fortunate enough to be at the right place at the right time to do this and so the con contributions that we tried to make embodied values that were not only of technical excellence and Innovation which I think we did certainly our share of but innovation in a more humanistic way um the things I'm most proud about of Apple are where those two things came together as an example in um publishing you know the Macintosh basically revolutionized publishing and printing and it was because of that typographic Artistry coupled with the technical uh understanding and Excellence to implement that electronically coming to those two things coming together um things coming together where people didn't have to understand Arcane computer commands to use the computer so it was a combination of those two things that I am the most proud of and it happened on the Apple 2 and it happened on the Lisa although there were other problems with the Lisa that caused it to be a market failure and it happened again big time with the Macintosh you used an interesting word when you were describing what you were doing uh you were talking about uh art not engineering not science you want to talk about that for a minute um sure I you know I believe that the distinction between a uh we generally use the word artist to mean visual artist of some sort but I actually think there's really very little distinction between an artist of that type and a scientist or engineer of the highest caliber uh and I've never had a distinction in my mind between those two types of people they've just to me been people that pursue different paths but basically kind of headed to the same goal which is to express some something of the of what they perceive to be the truth around them so that others can see it so that others can benefit by it and the Artistry is in the Elegance of the solution like chess playing or mathematics no I think the Artistry is in is in having an insight into what one sees around them generally putting things together in ways that no one else has and finding a way to express that to other people who don't have that same Insight so that they can get some of the advantage of that Insight that makes them feel a certain way or allows them to do a certain thing and and um I think that uh certainly a lot of the folks on the Macintosh team uh were capable of doing that and did exactly that and if you if you study these people a little bit more what you'll find was you know in this particular time I don't know how it will be in 200 years but certainly in the in the in the in the 70s and 80s the the best people in computers would have normally been poets and writers and musicians I mean almost all of them were musicians uh a lot of them were were poets on the side and they went into computers because it was so compelling because it was fresh and new and it was a new medium of expression of their creative talents and and the feelings and the passion that people put into it were completely indistinguishable from from a poet or a painter uh completely indistin and and I think there was a tremendous amount of um you know a lot of the people also were were not were fairly shy people or maybe fairly inward people who put a lot of their expression about how they felt about other people or the rest of humanity in general into their work that other people would use a lot of people put a lot of love into these products and a lot of expression of their appreciation into these things uh it's hard to explain no it's passionate in in the truest sense of the word so it's um and I don't think this is this is this is becoming less true unfortunately the computer industry is at a very critical juncture where the those people are clearly leaving the field now um what are they doing well where are they going hard to say it's they're not being they're not being attracted by something else they're being driven out of the computer business and they're being driven out of the computer business um because the computer business is becoming a monopoly with Microsoft and uh without getting into whether Microsoft gained this position legally or not uh who cares uh the end product of the position is that the ability to innovate in the industry is being sucked out dry and I think um the smartest people are have already seen some of the writing on the wall and are starting to exit um and I think some of the smartest young people are really out questioning whether they're going to even get in so uh hopefully things will change over time but I think it's it's a kind of a dark dark period right now um or entering that well Apple had a reputation as a company that that that absolutely broke a mold and set its own course uh looking back from where you are today with next um do you think with what you know now that as Apple grew big uh uh it could have sustained that original approach or did it have to become a a big standard American computer question Apple did grow big and sustain that approach when I left Apple it was2 billion company I mean that's not too small we were fortune 300 and something like the 350th largest company in the country um you know when the Mac was introduced we were a billion dollar Corporation so Apple you know Grew From nothing to2 billion dollar when I was there that's a pretty high growth rate and it you know it grew it grew five times since I left basically on the back of the Macintosh so I I think what it's happened since I left in terms of growth rates been been trivial compared with what it was like when I was there no what rued Apple um wasn't growth what runed Apple was values the John Scully runed Apple uh and he ruined it by bringing a set of values to the top of Apple which were corrupt and that corrupted some of the top people that were there drove out some of the ones that were not corruptible and brought in more corrupt ones and paid themselves literally collectively you know tens of tens of millions of dollars and cared really more about their own glory and wealth than they did about what what built Apple in the first place which was making great computers for people to use they didn't care about that anymore and they didn't have a clue about how to do it and they didn't take any time to find out because that's not what they cared about they cared about making a lot of money and so they had this wonderful thing that a lot of very brilliant people made called the Macintosh and they got very greedy and instead of following the original trajectory of the original Vision which was to make this thing an appliance and get this out there to as many people as possible they went for profits and they made Outland landish profits for about four years one of the most profitable companies in America for four years and what that cost them was their future because what they should have been doing is making rational profits and going for market share which is what we'd always tried to do and and Macintosh would have had a 33% market share right now maybe even higher maybe it would have been Microsoft but we'll never know and now it's got a single digigit market share and fall fall in and there's no way to ever get that moment in time back and the Macintosh will die in another few years and it's really sad uh and the problem is is that the the recipe for how to create the next Macintosh no one at Apple has a clue because no one running any part of Apple was there when the Macintosh was made or any other product at Apple they've just been living off that one thing now for over a decade and the last attempt was the Newton and you know what happened to that so it's kind of tragic but as unemotionally as I can be um that's what's happening and unless somebody pulls a rabbit out of a hat you know these things companies tend to have long Glide slopes because of the installed bases sure but Apple's just gliding down this Glide slope and they're losing market share every year and uh um things start to spiral once you get under a certain threshold developers no longer write applications for your computer so you know it's then it really starts to spiral down sure I well this obviously I mean there's obviously still a lot of emotional attachment to oh sure I want Apple to live forever and keep shipping great products forever and I mean Apple could have been a apple was for a while like a Sony it was the place that made the coolest stuff is there a um is there a user of apple or or um oh sure or story that that you could tell that that s that in your mind exemplifies what the company stood for and its values at its best sort of a you know what what what customers were using the Apple products when you were there there were two two kinds of customers I mean basically Apple was sort of there was the educational aspects of apple and then there was sort of the the non-educational on the non-educational side you know Apple was was two things one it was the first lifestyle computers I mean Macintosh was the first lifestyle computer but secondly it really it's hard to remember how bad it was you know in 19 early 80s with IBM taking over the world with the PC with Doss out there it was it was far worse than the Apple 2 they tried to copy the Apple 2 and they' done a pretty bad job and you needed to know a lot and so things were kind of slipping backwards and Macintosh was you saw the 1984 commercial oh yeah put that I hope you have that in your archives you know Macintosh was basically this uh this relatively small company you know in copertino California taking on the Goliath IBM and saying wait a minute your way is wrong MH this is not the way we want Compu computers to go this is not the Legacy we want to leave this is not what we want our kids to be learning this is wrong and we are going to show you the right way to do it and here it is it's called MacIntosh and this is so much better that it's going to beat you and we are GNA do it yeah and that's what Apple stood for was was that I was I was and that was one of the things the other thing was you can go a little further back in time and you know Apple twos one of the things that built Apple was schools buying Apple twos but even so there was I think only about 10% of the schools that had a computer even one computer in them in 1979 I think it was and when I grew up I was again lucky because I was in Silicon Valley when I was 12 I think I saw my first computer 10 10 or 11 maybe 11 or 12 it was down at NASA as and uh it was I didn't see the computer I saw a terminal and there was theoretically a computer on the other end of the wire and I fell in love with it and I saw my first desktop computer at H Packard which was one of their it was called the 9100a it was the first first desktop computer in the world ran basic and APL I think and I fell in love with them and I thought as we looking at these statistics in 1979 I thought you know if there was just one computer in every school some of the kids would find it you know yeah it was just there someone will find it and it will change their life and we saw the rate at which this was happening and the rate at which the school bureaucracies were deciding to buy a computer for school and it was so slow that that we realized that a whole generation of kids was going to go through the school system before they even got their first computer so we thought the kids can't wait for this basically and we wanted to donate a computer to every school in America turns out there's about 100,000 schools in America about 10,000 High School go about 90,000 K through through eight and we couldn't afford that as a company so we studied the law and it turned out that there was a law already on the books in a a national law that said if you donate a a piece of uh scientific instrumentation or computer to a university for educational and research purposes you can take an extra tax deduction for that that basically means you don't make any money you lose some but you don't lose too much you lose about 10% and we thought if we could apply that law if if we could enhance that law a little bit to extend it down to k through eight and remove the research requirements so it just was educational then we could give a 100,000 computers away one to each school in America and it would cost our company $10 million which was a lot of money to us at that time but it was a lot less than the 100 million it would cost us if we didn't have that and we decided we were willing to do that and we we actually it was the most incredible thing one of the most incredible things I've ever done we found our local representative a guy Nam Pete Stark over uh in I think it was uh East Bay and Pete uh and a few of us sat down and we wrote A bill we literally drafted a bill to make these changes and we committed we said if if the if this Law changes we will donate 100,000 computers at a cost of $10 million to us and we called it the kids can't wait Bill and Pete Stark introduced it in the house and uh Senator Danforth introduced it in the Senate and I refused to hire any lobbyists um and I went back to Washington myself and I actually walked the halls of Congress for about two two weeks and it was most incredible thing I met probably 2third of the house and over half of the Senate myself and sat down and talked with him God and um it was very interesting I found the house members were routinely less intelligent than the senate members and they were much more knee-jerk to their constituency which I found initially quite offensive but I came to understand that maybe that's a really good idea maybe that's the way the framers wanted it they weren't supposed to think too much they were supposed to represent maybe the senators were supposed to think a little more but it's a precursor it was very it was very interesting anyway the bill passed the house with the largest favorable majority of any tax bill in the history of this country okay wow what happened was it was during Carter's lame duck session and Bob Dole who was then the Speaker of the House killed it he would not bring it to the floor and we ran out a time and so we would have had to have started the entire process over the next year and I gave up I said this is this is crazy however fortunately something unique happened California thought this was such a good idea that they came to us and they said we're you don't have to do a thing we're going to pass a bill that says since you operate in the state of California pay California tax we're going to pass this bill that says if the federal bill doesn't pass then you get the tax right in California you can do it in California which there 10,000 schools so we did we gave away 10,000 computers in state of California we got a whole bunch of the software companies give away a bunch of software we trained teachers for free and we monitored this thing over the next few years it was phenomenal it was really phenomenal and one of my one of my great experiences but also one of my biggest regrets was that we really tried to do this on the national level and got so close great and I don't think Bob Dole even knew what he was doing but he really unfortunately screwed up here yeah major oh that's a that's a great story that's a great story but that's what that also part of what Apple was about now on the business side um I was at the Washington Post when the Macintosh was introduced and the Washington Post was a an IBM big blue shop and nobody was going to play with it that's right and um the Macintosh infiltrated the post there was almost a gorilla movement and it started with the um ad artists and now the whole front of the newspaper is being done on uh on Macintosh apple apple machines on the business side talk was that fairly common this uh this this oh sure gorilla sure cult movement on yeah see we had no concept of how to sell to Corporate America because none of us had ever come from there I mean it was like another planet to us I mean unfortunately I've had to learn all that stuff now and if I'd only known them what I known now we could have done a lot better but didn't know that stuff and didn't have any people that did so our attempts to sell to Corporate America were just bungled and we ended up just selling to people that sort of were buying a product for its Merit not because of the company it came from I mean everybody was very hooked on big blue back then oh yeah and they bought IBM mindlessly that famous phrase you never get fired for buying IBM um but we fortunately were able to change a lot of that and apple as you know even I believe today is a bigger supplier of personal computers than IBM great stories tell me about uh tell me about next what motivated you to establish next and what were the goals that you set out to accomplish when you set up this new company oh that's complicated um we basically wanted to keep doing what we were doing at Apple keep innovating and we did see that was going to happen and we made a mistake which was to try to follow the same metaphor that we did at Apple to make the whole widget and the market was changing the industry was changing the scale was changing and in the end we were we knew we would sort of be the last company that made it or the first that didn't you know we were right on that edge and we thought we'd be the last one that really made it but we were wrong we were the first one that didn't make it and I think pretty much put an end to the to the companies that have ever tried to do that um and we certainly made our fair share of mistakes but in the end I think we should have took a little longer and realized that the world was changing and just gone to be a software company right off the bat right off the bat um but the but the machine got got great reviews the machine was the best machine in the world Listen they're still believe it or not they're selling on the used market today for in some cases more than we sold them for originally they're hard to find even even today and we haven't even made them for you know two years two and a half years what are the features that people uh are are there features on the old next machine old it's not that old that are still missing from computers today or oh sure what give tell us about well first of all it was a totally plug-and play machine right that's except for Macintosh that's hard to find it was an extremely powerful machine they Way Beyond the Macintosh so it sort of combined the power of the workstations with this plug-and Pless of the Mac which is quite nice second of all the machine had a fit sort of a fit and finish that you don't find today um yeah beautiful Tri no I don't just mean in packaging I mean in sort of operation um simple things to complex things simple things like soft power on and off I mean trivia little thing but as you know one of the biggest re reasons people lose information in computers is they turn them off at the wrong time and when you get into a multitasking Network system that can happen that can even have much more severe consequences so you know we we were the first people to ever do that still some of the only people to do that where you push a button and you tell the computer you request the computer to turn off it figures out what it needs to do to shut down gracefully and then turns itself off um of course the next computer was the first computer with built-in you know high quality sound CD quality sound and most people do that now which is great it took them a long time but most people do that now just ahead of its time yeah just ahead of its time but change the tape uh I need ready ready ready roll um tell me about uh uh The Next Step software what makes it different what trends does it respond to that's the real gem um I'll tell you an interesting story uh when I was at Apple a few of my acquaintances said you really need to go over to Xerox Park which was paloalto Research Center PC and see what they've got going over there now they didn't usually let too many people in but I was able to get in there and see what they were doing and I saw their early computer called the alto which was a phenomenal computer and they actually showed me three things there that they had working in 1976 I saw them in 1979 that took really until a few years ago for us to fully recreate for the industry to fully recreate in this case with with nextstep uh however I didn't see those three things I only saw the first one which was so incredible to me that it saturated me it blinded me to see the other two and it took me years to sort of recreate them or ReDiscover them uh and incorporate them back into the model but they were very far ahead in their thinking they didn't have it right I mean the stuff they had done was not really right but it was The Germ of the idea of all three things was there and the three things were graphical user interfaces objectoriented Computing and networking let me go through those graphical user interfaces the alto had the world's first graphical user interface it had Windows it had a crude menu system it had crude panels and stuff chair didn't no it didn't work right right but it basically was all there objects they had Small Talk running the world's first or not the first but really basically the first objectoriented language simula was sort of the first but Small Talk was the first official objectoriented language third networking they invented Ethernet there as you know and they had about 200 alos with servers hooked up in a local area network there doing email and everything else over the network all in 19 79 I was so blown away with the potential of The Germ of that graphical user interface stuff I saw that I didn't even assimilate or even stick around to investigate fully the other two what next step was was the completion of turning some of that Vision into a reality incorporating the world's first truly commercial object-oriented system next step and really for its time being the most networked system in the world when it came out and um I think the world is has made a lot of progress in networking but hasn't yet crossed the hurdle into objects and what's happened with next step is it's really started to get adopted by some very large corporate customers and is now the most popular object-oriented system in the world as objects are on the threshold of uh starting to move into the mainstream and so the company last year recorded its first profit in its nine years history and uh sold $50 million worth of software I think we're going to have some significant growth this year and it's fairly clear that NEX can get up to being a few hundred million doll software company in the next three or four years and be the largest company offering objects until Microsoft comes into the market at some point in time uh probably with a pretty half-baked product um some people say that uh in the future object oriented software is going to be the only kind of the only oh of course of course that's true yeah the the minute I remember being at Xerox in 1979 because it was one of those sort of apocalyptic moments yeah um I remember within 10 minutes of seeing the graphical user interface stuff just knowing that every computer will work this way someday I mean it's so obvious once you saw it it didn't require tremendous intellect we just look of course every computer's going to work this way this is so clear um the minute you understand objects it's exactly the same feeling all software will be written using object or any technology someday you can argue about how long it's going to take I.E when you can argue about who the winners and losers are going to be uh but you I don't think a rational person can argue about its inevitability um tell me give me your thoughts uh on the current status and the future of um uh the internet and the commercial online services and how they're affecting computer development the internet and the worldwide web because they've become one thing now are clearly the most exciting thing going on in Computing today and they're exciting for three or four reasons number one uh ultimately commun computers are turning into Communications devices I mean ultimately we're spending more and more of the cycles of the computer to not only make it easy to use but to make it easy to communicate and the web is the missing piece of the puzzle uh which really is going to power that Vision much further forward uh so it's very exciting in that way secondly it's very exciting because it is going to destroy vast layers of our economy and it is going to make available uh a presence in the marketplace for very small companies that is equal to very large companies let me give you an example uh a small threers company in in Phoenix Arizona can have a web server that looks identical if not better than um than ibms or than um uh than uh you know the gaps or than anybody else any any large company and they can gain access to this electronic distribution Channel for free they don't have to build buildings they don't have to go sign up uh a thous Distributors and have people to call on them etc etc in essence direct distribution from the manufacturer to the customer via the internet via the web direct contact Direct transactions and then distribution via UPS or Federal Express that's going to be cheaper than going through all these middlemen or building hundreds of stores around the country it is going to radically change the way goods and services are discovered sold and delivered not only in this country but eventually in the world and as you know electrons travel at the speed of light and so it tends to bring the world much closer together in terms of providers and customers that's very exciting the leveling of big and small the leveling of close near and distance the third reason it's very exciting is because Microsoft doesn't own it it and I don't think they can I think it's it's the one thing in the industry that Microsoft probably could never own and I think one of the things that's essential is that the government continue to fund the internet as a public trust as a public facility and remove any of these ridiculous Notions of privatizing it uh that have been brought up I don't think they're going to fly thankfully the internet costs the US government about 50 to 75 million a year uh this is penuts for what it's doing right now and even if that cost someday escalated to you know half a billion a year which of course you could build the whole internet each year for that from scratch if you had to you could replace all the equipment Etc uh that would be an extraordinarily small price to pay for keeping it from getting into the hands of any one company and thereby starting to destroy or control The Innovation that could take place around the Internet it's the one last bright spot uh of Hope in the computer industry for some serious Innovation to happen at a rapid pace and what's Al great about it is again the US is in the Forefront here um that's what's great about the whole personal computer and software industry but this is another example of where the US is in the Forefront I think uh it should be kept open it should be kept free yeah how do you feel about I mean the the um worldwide web is literally is becoming a global phenomenon yes um are you optimistic about it stay free it's yes I am optimistic about it staying free but before you say it's Global too fast it's estimated that um over onethird of the total internet traffic in the world originates or destines in California so I actually think this is pretty typical where California again is certainly in the leading edge of this not only technical but cultural shift um and uh so I do expect the web to be a worldwide phenomenon uh distributed fairly broadly right now I think it's a it's a US phenomenon that's moving to be Global and again very concentrated in certain Pockets California being one oh yeah well 85% of the world doesn't have access to telephone yet so but potential there and and you're pretty optimistic um tell me about Pixar Pixar is very interesting uh I got hooked up with some folks uh again A friend of mine told me I should go visit these crazy guys up in San Rafel California who were working at Lucas film now George Lucas uh whom you know produced the Star Wars film Trilogy uh was a smart guy and at one point when he would had a lot of money coming in from these films realized that Auto started Technology Group he had a few problems he wanted to solve let me give you an example of one when you make a copy of an analog audio recording like a tape cassette to another tape cassette you pick up noise artifacts in this case hiss on the tape if you make a second generation copy gets worse exponentially the same is true of optical analog copies if you take a piece of film make an optical copy you pick up noise artifacts in this case Optical noise which uh comes across as blurriness in some cases comes across as other noise artifacts in other cases now George to make Star Wars actually had to composite together up to 13 pieces of film for each frame the matte paintings for the backgrounds might be a few pieces of film uh the the models might be a few pieces of film The liveaction might be a few pieces of film some special effects might be a few pieces of film and every time he'd make a copy to composite two together then add a third then add a fourth he was adding noise artifacts in each generation and if you go buy a laser disc of star any of the Star Wars movies and you stop it on some of the frames they are really grungy incredibly noisy very bad quality George being the perfectionist he was who figured out how to do this at all said I'd like to do it perfectly I'd like to do it digitally and nobody had ever done that before so he hired a some very smart people and they figured out how to do it for him digitally with no noise artifacts software and they actually built some specialized Hardware at the time George at some point decided that this was costing him several million dollars a year and decided he didn't want to fund it anymore so I bought this group from George Lucas and I Incorporated it as Pixar and we set about basically revolutionizing high-end computer Graphics if you look at the 10 most important Revolutions in high-end computer Graphics in the last 10 years eight of them have come out of Pixar um all of the software that was used to make uh Terminator as an example to actually construct the the images you saw on the screen or Jurassic Park with all the dinosaurs was Pixar software industrial Light and Magic uses it as the basis for all of their stuff um but Pixar had another Vision than to do special effects Pixar's Vision was to tell stories to make real films and so our our vision was to make the world's first animated feature film that was completely computer synthetic sets characters everything and after 10 years we have done exactly that um we have developed the tools which are all proprietary to do this to manage the production of this thing uh as well as the uh the drawing of this thing and the you know computer synthetic drawing and we are finishing up making the world's first computer animated feature film Pixar has written it directed it producing it uh and the Walt Disney Corporation is Distributing it and it's coming out this year as Walt Disney's Christmas picture it's coming out November 11th I believe and it's called Toy Story and you will hear a lot about it because I think it's going to be the most successful film of this year fantastic it's phenomenal uh Tom Hanks is the main character's Voice Tim Allen is the second main character Randy Newman's doing the music for it and it's just phenomenal oh well um since this is going to be in bargain for a while can you tell me a little bit about the about the story or um yeah but there's no purpose in 300 years they have seen it already so that's true I'm I'm I'm losing I'm losing my sense my sense of myself we got a couple more uh serious questions and then uh uh then I would like to just give you a chance to say anything else that that you wanted to add um just back on Pixar again for a minut though there's a lot of hoopa now about sort of Hollywood and Silicon Valley converging where they call it silly wood I think the Pixar really is going to be the first digital studio in the whole world um and really combines art and Technology together in again a very wonderful way Pixar's got by far in a way the best computer Graphics talent in the entire world and it now has the best anim and artistic talent in the whole world to do these kinds of films we have the second largest group of animators in the world now outside of Disney we think the most talented in the world uh working side by side with these computer scientists the best graphics people in the world and uh there's really no one else in the world that could do this it's it's really phenomenal I think we're probably close to 10 years ahead of anybody else sounds really exciting well the question I was going to ask or uh and you partially asked it answered it uh was about um uh startup companies as I I look around the facility here uh and in your literature their alliances written all over the walls I literally Sun art I mean you're align with the H packet and sun and Oracle and digital and all the systems integ GRS um Communications companies and uh information technology companies are emerging and becoming one do you think uh will ever be possible uh for a uh a new major o uh major startup company to develop if they're going to focus on major applications or we ever will there ever be another yeah you know it's I think yes intellectually sometimes one would say in despair no but I think yes and the reason is is because it's not technology keeps on advancing so there there are opportunities but the thing that makes it possible is that human Minds settle into fixed ways of looking at the world and that that's always been true and it's probably always going to be true and I think you know I've always felt that death is the greatest invention of life I'm sure that life evolved without death at first and found that that without death life didn't work very well because it didn't make room for the young who didn't know how the world was you know 50 years ago who didn't know how the world was 20 years ago but who saw it as it is today without any preconceptions and saw and dreamed how it could be based on that who were not satisfied based on the accomplishments of the last 30 years but who were dissatisfied because the current state didn't live up to their ideals without death there would be very little progress and so one of the things that happens in organizations as well as in people is they settle into ways of looking at the world and become satisfied with those and the world changes and keeps evolving and new potential arises but these people that are settled in don't see it and that's what gives startup companies their greatest Advantage is is the this the the sedentary point of view of of large companies and in addition to that large companies usually do not have very efficient communication paths from the people closest to some of these changes at the bottom of the company to the top of the company which are the people making the big decisions and so by the time there may be people at the lower levels of these companies that see these changes coming but by the time the word ripples up to the highest levels where they can do something about it sometimes 10 years passes and um even in the case where part of the company does the right thing at the lower levels usually the upper levels screwed up somehow I mean IBM the personal computer business was a good example of that so I think as long as as uh you know humans don't solve this this this human nature trait of sort of settling in to a world view after a while there will always be opportunity for young companies as well as young people to innovate uh as it should be and that was going to be um my closing my closing question before or um I gave you a chance to just sort of free associate on your own U and that is to talk to young people who sort of look to you as a as a role model um uh opportunities for Innovation you think are still possible um what are the factors for success for young people uh today and what pitfalls should they avoid if you're playing the role of Elder Statesman for entrepreneurs yeah for young young young entrepreneurial oh I get asked this a lot and I have a pretty standard answer which is a lot of people come to me and they say well I want to be an entrepreneur and I go oh that's great what's your idea and they go well I don't have one yet and I say well I think you should go get a job as a bus boy or something until you find something you're really passionate about because it's a lot of work and I'm convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the nonsuccessful ones is pure perseverance it is so hard you pour so much your life into this thing there are such rough moments in time that most people give up I don't blame them it's really tough and it consumes your life I mean if you're if you've got a family and you're in the early days of a company it's I can't imagine how one could do it I'm sure it's it's been done but it's rough I mean because it's a pretty much you know 18h hour day job seven days a week for a while so unless you have a lot of passion about this you're going to not survive you're going to give it up so you got to have an idea of and or a problem or a a wrong that you want to write that you're passionate about otherwise you're not going to have the perseverance to stick it through and I think that's half the battle right there ah well I lied because your your talking made me think of think of the other side of that we talked about the passion side what would you say there's passion and there's power what would you say as about the responsib of power once you've achieved a certain level of success power yeah um what is that you need to you need passion to build a company like apple or IBM or or or any other major company but once you've achieved once you've taken the passion to that level and have built a company and uh are in a position like Bill Gates at Microsoft or or anybody else yourself um what the responsibilities of those who have succeeded and have economic power Social Power I mean you've changed the world uh what are your responsibilities within that with that framework or paradig oh I think I mean that question can be taken on many levels obviously if you're running a company you have responsibilities but as an individual uh I don't think you have responsibilities I think the work speaks for itself and I I don't think that that people have special responsibilities just because they've done something that other people you know like or don't like or what have you I think the work speaks for itself um I think people can choose to do things if they want to um but you know I mean we're all going to be dead soon that's my point of view you know somebody once told me they said uh live each day as if it will be your last and one day you'll certainly be right you know and I do that and I I really you never know when you're going to go uh but you know you are going to go pretty soon and what you know if you're going to leave anything behind you know it's going to be you know your kids few friends and your work right so that's what I tend to worry about I don't tend to think about responsibility um matter of fact I tend to like to on occasion pretend I don't have any responsibilities I try to remember the last day when I didn't have anything to do and I had nothing to do the following day that I had to do I had no responsibilities and it was you know decades ago so I have to pretend when I want to feel that way um so I I I don't think in those terms I think you have a responsibility to do really good stuff and get it out there for people to use and let them build on the shoulders of it and keep making better stuff so the responsibilities to yourself and to your own standards and well in our business you know one person can't do anything anymore but you create a team of people around you and you have a responsibility of Integrity of the work to that team everybody does and you try to turn out the best work you can any um any final comments or thoughts either for the record or or off the Record no not really time frame is an interesting thing when you think about people you know looking back I I do think when people look back on this in a hundred years they're going to see this is a remarkable time in history is incredibly and especially this area believe it or not I mean I think when you look at the Innovation that's come out of this area just this Bay Area Silicon Valley and the whole San Francisco Berkeley Bay Area you know you've got the invention of the integrated circuit the invention of the microprocessor the invention of semiconductor memory right the certainly the invention of the modern hard disk drive the invention of the floppy disc drive not sorry the invention of the modern floppy disc drive those were invented at IBM the hard dis and the floppy disc but the the commercialization of those things the invention of the personal computer the invention of genetic engineering the invention of object-oriented technology the invention of graphical user interfaces at Park followed by Apple the invention of networking all that happened in this Bay Area and incredible yeah why do you think it happened why here these people these this place this uh two or three reasons this place is a remarkable Place actually I mean you have to go back a little bit in history I mean this is where the beatnik era happened you know San Francisco that's a pretty interesting thing this is where the hippie movement happened this is the only place in America that where rock and roll really happened right it's all the bands I mean most of the bands in this country outside of Bob Dylan in the 60s I mean they all came out of here everything from Joan bz to you know Jefferson Airplane to the Grateful Dead I mean everything came out of here Janice Joplin Jimmy Hendricks everybody everybody why is that that's a little strange when you think about it um and then you've also had Stanford and Berkeley two awesome universities drawing smart people from all over the world and depositing them in this clean Sunny nice place where there's a whole bunch of other smart people and pretty good food right and you know at times a lot of drugs and a lot of fun things to do so they stayed and and so there's a lot of human capital pouring in here right a lot of human capital really smart people the average you know people seem pretty bright here relative to the rest of the country and people seem pretty open-minded here relative to the rest of the country um and I think uh it's just a very unique place and it's got I think it's got the track record to prove it so that tends to attract more people too and um I I give a lot of credit to the universities probably the most credit of anything to Stanford and Berkeley UC see Cal yeah it's great thanks well I cannot tell you how much you appreciate it sure I hope it's helpful oh and it it it will be um we'll give you a copy of this and um and well I just did uh David Packard yesterday and for
